"""Reference contribution — read this before writing your own.

This file is the shape every contributed module must take. It is small on
purpose: your module can be a scheduler, a replayer, a tool host, a model
catalog, anything — as long as this skeleton holds.

Rules (enforced mechanically by ``forge/registry.py``):

1. ``MODULE_API_VERSION`` must equal the value the registry expects.
2. Exactly two public functions: ``register(api)`` and ``selftest()``.
3. ``register`` returns a manifest with ``name`` (== file stem),
   ``version``, ``capabilities``; optionally ``hooks``.
4. ``selftest()`` returns ≥ 8 ``(name, ok, detail)`` tuples and passes offline.
5. Pure standard library. No network, no subprocess, no destructive file calls.
6. Never import another contribution — talk through ``api`` instead.
